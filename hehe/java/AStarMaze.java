// # Initialization:
// # Create an open list (priority queue) to store the nodes to be evaluated.
// # Create a closed list to store the nodes that have already been evaluated.
// # The starting node is added to the open list.
// # Loop until goal is found or open list is empty:

// # Get the node with the lowest f = g + h from the open list, where:
// # g is the cost to reach the current node.
// # h is the heuristic cost (estimate) from the current node to the goal.
// # If the current node is the goal, reconstruct the path and exit.
// # Otherwise, move the current node to the closed list.
// # For each neighbor of the current node:
// # If the neighbor is already in the closed list, skip it.
// # Otherwise, calculate the g, h, and f values and add the neighbor to the open list if it isnâ€™t already there or has a better f value.
// # Heuristic Function: For the heuristic function (H-cost), a common choice for a maze is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the x and y coordinates between the current node and the goal node.
