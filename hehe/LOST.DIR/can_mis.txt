Missionaries and Cannibal Problem:-

On one bank of a river are three missionaries and three cannibals. There is one boat available that
can hold up to two people and that they would like to use to cross the river. If the cannibals ever
outnumber the missionaries on either of the riverâ€™s banks, the missionaries will get eaten.
How can the boat be used to safely carry all the missionaries and cannibals across the river?

Breath First Search
Algorithm
1. Create a variable called NODE-LIST and set it to the initial state.
2. Loop until the goal state is found or NODE-LIST is empty.

a. Remove the first element, say E, from the NODE-LIST. If NODE-LIST
was empty then quit.

b. For each way that each rule can match the state described in E do:
i) Apply the rule to generate a new state.
ii) If the new state is the goal state, quit and return this state.
iii) Otherwise add this state to the end of NODE-LIST

Procedure/Algorithm:
Here openlist is Queue and Closelist is visited
1. Create a structure for storing current state
2. Function to generate successors.
3. Create a structure for storing all successors of current state.
4. Create a structure for storing non-repeating/Not visited(Open) successors
5. Create a structure for storing repeating/Visited (Close) successors
6. Function for moving from current to next state
7. If generated successor has been already traversed, putting it into closed structure
8. If generated successor is a new state, putting it into open structure
9. Print if goal state achieved else Backtracking if goal state not achieved


Production Rules for Missionaries and Cannibals problem
Rule No. Rules and Action
1 (x,y): Two missionaries can go only when x-2 >= y or x-2 = 0 in one bank and x +2 >= y in the other bank

2 (x,y): Two cannibals can cross the river only when y-2 <= x or x = 0 in one bank and y +2 <= x or x=0 in the other bank.

3 (x,y): one missionary and one cannibals can go in the boat only when x-1 >= y-1 or x = 0 in one bank and x +1 >= y+1 or x=0 in the other bank.

4 (x,y): one missionary can cross the river only when x-1 >= y or x = 0 in one bank and x +1 >= y in the other bank.

5 (x,y): one cannibal can cross the river only when y-1 < x or x = 0 in one bank and y +1 <= x or y = 0 in the other bank.
