Problem Statement
Given an 8x8 chess board, you must place 8 queens on the board so that no two queens
attack each other. Print all possible matrices satisfying the conditions with positions with
queens marked with '1' and empty spaces with '0'. You must solve the 8 queens problem
using backtracking.
 Note 1: A queen can move vertically, horizontally and diagonally in any number of
steps.
 Note 2: You can also go through the N-Queen Problem for the general approach to
solving this problem.

What is Backtracking?
 Backtracking the solution of the problem depends on the previous steps taken. We
take a step and then analyze it that whether it will give the correct answer or not?
And if not, then we move back and change the previous step.

Backtracking Approach
This approach rejects all further moves if the solution is declined at any step, goes back to
the previous step and explores other options.
Algorithm
Let's go through the steps below to understand how this algorithm of solving the 8 queens
problem using backtracking works:
 Step 1: Traverse all the rows in one column at a time and try to place the queen in that
position.
 Step 2: After coming to a new square in the left column, traverse to its left horizontal
direction to see if any queen is already placed in that row or not. If a queen is found,
then move to other rows to search for a possible position for the queen.
 Step 3: Like step 2, check the upper and lower left diagonals. We do not check the
right side because it's impossible to find a queen on that side of the board yet.
 Step 4: If the process succeeds, i.e. a queen is not found, mark the position as '1' and
move ahead.
 Step 5: Recursively use the above-listed steps to reach the last column. Print the
solution matrix if a queen is successfully placed in the last column.
 Step 6: Backtrack to find other solutions after printing one possible solution.
