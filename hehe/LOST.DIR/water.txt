Water Jug Problem:
This is the water jug problem using simple depth-first search of a graph. Jug X holds 4 liters,
and jug Y holds 3 liters. There is a pump, which can be used to fill either Jug. How can you
get exactly 2 liters of water into the 4-liter jug?
Assumptions:
a) We can fill a jug from the pump
b) We can pour water out of the jug onto the ground
c) We can pour water from one jug to another
d) There are no other measuring devices available

To solve the water jug problem, apart from problem statement we also need a control structure
that loops through a simple cycle in which some rule whose left side matches the current state is
chosen, the appropriate change to state is made as described in corresponding right side and the
resulting state is checked to see if it corresponds to a goal state.

Depth First Search :
The DFS algorithm works as follows:
1. Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices on top of a stack.
2. Take the top item of the stack and add it to the visited list.
3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to
the top of stack.
4. Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the stack is empty.

Procedure/Algorithm:
1. Create a structure for storing current state
2. Create a structure for storing non-repeating(Open) successors
3. Create a structure for storing repeating (Close) successors
4. Create a structure for storing all successors of current state
5. Function to generate successors
6. Function for moving from current to next state
7. If generated successor has been already traversed, putting it into closed structure
8. If generated successor is a new state, putting it into open structure
9. Print if goal state Achieved else Backtracking if goal state not achieved


The following table gives the production rule to solve the water jug problem
