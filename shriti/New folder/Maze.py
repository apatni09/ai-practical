# Initialization:

# Create an open list (priority queue) to store the nodes to be evaluated.
# Create a closed list to store the nodes that have already been evaluated.
# The starting node is added to the open list.
# Loop until goal is found or open list is empty:

# Get the node with the lowest f = g + h from the open list, where:
# g is the cost to reach the current node.
# h is the heuristic cost (estimate) from the current node to the goal.
# If the current node is the goal, reconstruct the path and exit.
# Otherwise, move the current node to the closed list.
# For each neighbor of the current node:
# If the neighbor is already in the closed list, skip it.
# Otherwise, calculate the g, h, and f values and add the neighbor to the open list if it isnâ€™t already there or has a better f value.
# Heuristic Function: For the heuristic function (H-cost), a common choice for a maze is the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the x and y coordinates between the current node and the goal node.
